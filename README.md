# Elite Arduino Joystick
Analog joystick thruster control code for Aurduino Uno or Leonardo.

Purpose:
Microcontroller code for secondary thumb joystick to replace pilots tendencies to control vertical and horizontal thrust with the HAT controls.  Really, a HAT on a joystick is pathetic.  It really is nothing more than 4 buttons.  We do not need a HAT Control on a joystick.  1  HAT control on a joystick is 1 HAT control too many.  We need this thumb joystick instead and in its place.
